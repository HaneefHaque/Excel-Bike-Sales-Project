# Excel-Bike-Sales-Project

### Project Overview

I completed a data analysis project using Excel to explore customer data and identify key patterns behind bike purchases. The goal was to understand what demographic and lifestyle factors influenced buying behaviour.

### Process

I started by cleaning and preparing the data, checking for blanks, correcting data types, and filtering irrelevant rows. Using Excel formulas and conditional formatting, I made the dataset easier to explore. I then built pivot tables to summarise trends across age, gender, income, marital status, and commuting distance.

To make insights clear and engaging, I designed a dashboard using slicers, charts, and pivot summaries. This allowed me to interactively show how different groups (e.g. married vs. single, short vs. long commute) contributed to bike purchases.

### Results

The analysis revealed that:

- Higher-income individuals were more likely to purchase bikes.

- Married individuals with children had a higher likelihood of buying.

- Those with shorter commutes and access to fewer cars were more inclined to cycle.

These findings could help a business refine its marketing strategy to better target likely buyers.
